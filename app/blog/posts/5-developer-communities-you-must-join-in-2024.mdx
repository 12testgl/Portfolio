## Introduction

Joining a Developer Community can be a Game Changer for Developers! And For Me it truly was a Game-changer!

The Support, Resources, Networking Opportunities I got from Tech Communities are Priceless! And apart from these Tech Stuff, I also got some Good Friends! Overall, Developer Community Helped me ( A LOT ) to grow in my career!

In this Article I'll share 5 Developer Communities (Obviosly My favorites) you must join to grow in your career!

## Why only 5 not 20?

It's a very good Question! You might be thinking that if you join more communities you'll networking and opportunities!

Yes, You can join 10 or 20 Communities But it's very hardly that you'll be **active on all of them**!

So, From my personal experience I would recommend to join less communities and Be active there! And Believe me it's hard to be active in 5 communities as well : )

## 5 Dev Communities

Here are my Favourite 5 Communities that you must join:

### 1\. EddieHub
