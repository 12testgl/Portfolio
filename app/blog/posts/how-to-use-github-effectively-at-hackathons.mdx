# Introduction

In this blog post, we'll go over some best practices for using GitHub at hackathons. Every time we take part in a hackathon, we upload our project to Github and include the GitHub URL in our project submission.GitHub plays a significant part in how judges evaluate your project!

By the end of this blog, you'll understand how to use GitHub to your advantage at hackathons and be well on your way to creating a successful project. So let's get started!

## Usually Forgotten features:

### 1\. GitHub Commit History:

This is usually mentioned in the Hackathon Rules. There could be mentioned that they will be checking the commit history of the project to ensure that you have made that project during the hackathon period not before.

> Tip: Don't Push your full code in one commit ! Instead , try to build your project from the beiginning on the Github.

It's also recommended to create a repo as soon as the Hacking period starts and start building there! Then push the small changes & features you added to the Repo.

You can find that there are some Minimum Commit Criteria. In that case, you will get an edge!

> "Try to maintain good commit history while you are trying to work on a project!"

### 2\. GitHub Issues

When we try to work on short-term projects like hackathon projects, we often feel that the Github Issues feature is not Important. But Adding issues while working on a project is a good practice. Many judges like to see that on your project. You can use that as your To-Do list or Group Discussion about a new feature.

**<mark>ðŸ“ŒNote</mark>**: You don't have to put Technical or hard definitions on an issue, It can be very simple.

Creating this type of issue shows your thinking process and brainstorming process all over to the judges which can eventually give you an edge in the Hackathon.

### 3\. Project Boards

Like GitHub Issues, most people think that Github Project Boards are not useful. But In Reality, It shows a bit of your Project management skills.

Suppose, Your project is very good but you can show the judges How you managed the project and put priorities on the issues. It creates a good impression that you are taking the project seriously and want to get it done systematically.

### 4\. GitHub Community Standards

If you are trying to build a project It is very essential. It's very good to have Community standards not only for hackathon projects but also for other projects.

If you go to insights you can see community standards there

In Insights if you go to Community standards you can see a checklist. Even if you forget anything to add to your Repo! you can check that here. Just try to complete this checklist.

Example: Here Security policy has not been added yet!

>   Just putting your code on GitHub doesn't make your project open source,
>   adding a license, Readme, Code of Conduct, and documentation to it makes it
>   an Open Source project altogether
> </mark>
> **<mark>.</mark>**

**ðŸ”®Tip:**

For the Hackathon project, you don't have to enable Github Discussion.

### 5\. GitHub Project Tag

You might be thinking why it is important?

### 6\. GitHub ReadMe

A good README file is an important part of any GitHub project. It provides information about the project, including its purpose, how to set it up, and how to use it.

Having a well-written README can help users understand your project and decide whether they want to use it. It can also help contributors understand how to contribute to the project and what kind of help is needed.

ðŸ’Ž Here are some benefits of having a good README for your GitHub project:

- It helps users understand what the project does and how it can be useful to them.
- It provides clear instructions on how to install and set up the project.
- It explains how to use the project and what features are available.
- It lists any dependencies that are required to run the project.
- It gives credit to contributors and maintainers.
- It provides a place for users to report issues and request features.

In summary, a good README can make your project more user-friendly and help it gain more users and contributors.

There are also some features that you can disable! if your project doesn't have any Releases & packages you can disable them otherwise it doesn't look nice.
