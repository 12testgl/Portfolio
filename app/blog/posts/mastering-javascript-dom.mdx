## Introduction:

DOM is the backbone for building dynamic, responsive, and interactive web applications.

In this Article, We'll explore What is DOM ( Document Object Model ), its Structure, How to access DOM elements, Manipulate them and many more...

Excited?

Me Too!

So without delaying Further, Let's START!

## What is DOM?

The word "DOM" stands for Document Object Model.

The DOM is a Web API that directly interacts with HTML elements and changes/manipulates them. It's a reliable way to make changes that turn static websites into dynamic ones.

<div data-node-type="callout">
  <div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
  <div data-node-type="callout-text">
    NOTE: DOM is a cross-platform and language-independent way of manipulating
    HTML and XML documents.
  </div>
</div>

## DOM Structure:

The DOM represents an HTML document as a hierarchy of nodes.

Let's take a simple HTML code:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>DOM Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, DOM!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

The Tree representation of this code will be :

<div data-node-type="callout">
  <div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
  <div data-node-type="callout-text">
    NOTE: Each document can have only one <code>document</code> element. In an
    HTML document, the <code>document</code> element is the{" "}
    <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.
  </div>
</div>

### Node Types

Each node in the DOM tree is identified by a node type. JavaScript uses integer numbers to determine the node types. The following table illustrates the node type constants:

| **Constant**                       | **Value** | **Description**                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Node.ELEMENT_NODE`                | `1`       | An `Element` node like `<p>` or `<div>`.                                       |
| `Node.TEXT_NODE`                   | `3`       | The actual `Text` inside an `Element` or `Attr`.                               |
| `Node.CDATA_SECTION_NODE`          | `4`       | A `CDATASection`, such as `<!CDATA[[ â€¦ ]]>`.                                   |
| `Node.PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE` | `7`       | A `ProcessingInstruction` of an XML document, such as `<?xml-stylesheet â€¦ ?>`. |
| `Node.COMMENT_NODE`                | `8`       | A `Comment` node, such as `<!-- â€¦ -->`.                                        |
| `Node.DOCUMENT_NODE`               | `9`       | A `Document` node.                                                             |
| `Node.DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE`          | `10`      | A `DocumentType` node, such as `<!DOCTYPE html>`.                              |
| `Node.DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE`      | `11`      | A `DocumentFragment` node.                                                     |

To get the type of node, you use the `nodeType` property:

```javascript
node.nodeType;
```

## Accessing DOM elements:

To change/manipulate different parts of the website, we need to access those elements. We have four methods in Javascript to Access elements. They are:

1. `getElementById`,
2. `getElementsByClass`,
3. `querySelector`,
4. `querySelectorAll`.

### 1\. getElementById() method:

It's the most common way to access elements. Let's understand this with an example:

```javascript
const first = document.getElementById("id_name");
```

Here We are accessing the element that has the id "id_name" and printing that.

### 2\. getElementByClassName() method:

This method is quite similar to the previous method. With this method, we can access the elements by their class. The `getElementsByClassName()` method returns an array-like of objects of the child elements with a specified class name.

```javascript
let elements = document.getElementsByClassName(names);
```

<div data-node-type="callout">
  <div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
  <div data-node-type="callout-text">
    This method will access all elements with the same class.
  </div>
</div>

### 3\. querySelector() method:

The `querySelector()` method allows us to select the first element that matches one or more CSS selectors.

```javascript
let element = parentNode.querySelector(selector);
```

Here, the `selector` is a CSS selector or a group of CSS selectors.

### 4\. querySelectorAll() method:

It's Similar to `querySelectorAll()` but unlike `querySelectorAll()`, It selects all elements that match the selectors.

```javascript
let element = parentNode.querySelectorAll(selector);
```

## DOM Manipulation:

After accessing the elements, we can also perform various kinds of changes/manipulations with the selected elements. This is a crucial aspect of creating dynamic and interactive web applications.

Now, let's see some common DOM Manipulation Techniques:

### 1\. Creating new Elements:

We can create new elements using `document.createElement()` method. Let's see one example:

```javascript
var newDiv = document.createElement("div");
```

Here we are creating a new div and storing it in a variable named `'newDiv'` .

### 2\. Adding text to elements

After creating the new div, we'll add some text to the newly created div.

```javascript
newDiv.textContent = "Newly added div";
```

We have used the `textContent` to add the text content to the div.

### 3\. Adding HTML Snippets to elements:

Just like the previous method, We can also use `innerHTML` method to add an HTML snippet within the div.

```javascript
newDiv.innerHTML = "<p>Created new element with innerHTML</p>";
```

### 4\. Adding element to the parent node:

After creating the `newDiv` we'll now append it to the parent div using `appendChild()` method.

> Note: The `appendChild()` method allows you to add a node to the end of the list of child nodes of a specified parent node.
>
> Syntax:
>
> ```javascript
> parentNode.appendChild(childNode);
> ```
>
> The `childNode` is the node to append to the given parent node. The `appendChild()` returns the appended child.

```javascript
document.body.appendChild(newDiv);
```

Here, The element `newDiv` is appended/added to the `body` and this adds the `div` at the end of the body content.

### 5\. **Removing Elemen**ts:

Just like appending the element, we can also delete/remove the element from the parent node using `removeChild()` method.

```javascript
document.body.removeChild(newDiv);
```

Here, The element `newDiv` removed from the parent node (which is `body` here).

### 6\. **Updating St**yles:

We can also update the styling of the div using the style property.

```javascript
newDiv.style.backgroundColor = "lightblue";
```

This will set the background color of the `newDiv` as `lightblue`.

### **7**. **Event Handling:**

Another key aspect of DOM manipulation is responding to user interaction. That means when the user performs different actions (clicks, key presses, or form submissions.), the program will respond accordingly.

We handle the event using event listeners.

Let's see one example:

```javascript
var button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", function () {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});
```

Here, when the user clicks the button, it will show an alert message that "button clicked"
