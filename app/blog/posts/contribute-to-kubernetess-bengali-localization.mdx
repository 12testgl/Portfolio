# Introduction

One way to get involved in open source and enhance your profile is by contributing to the Kebernetes Localization . You don't need any technical knowledge to contribute, as non-code contributions are welcome. This is a great opportunity to get involved and make a difference in the open source community.

# What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is a popular open-source container orchestration platform that is widely used in the cloud-native computing community. It allows users to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications across a cluster of machines.

# Why Localization?

One important aspect of Kubernetes is localization, which allows users to access the platform and its documentation in their native language. This is especially important for non-English speaking users, as it helps them better understand and utilize the platform

# **Steps to Contribute**

If you are a Bengali speaker and want to contribute to the Kubernetes community by helping to localize the platform and its documentation into Bengali, here are some easy steps that you can follow:

1. Go to the [kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes)/[**website**](https://github.com/kubernetes/website) Github Page & Fork the Repository.

2. Join The Slack Channel.

   - Join the [Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/)
   - Join the [kubernetes-docs-bn](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/kubernetes-docs-bn), [sig-docs-localizations](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-docs-localizations)

3. Then go to this Bengali Localization Issue link and select the desired `.md` file from the Tracking Issue and comment “I would like to contribute on `content/bn/<chosen_file_name>.md` "

4. After some time you will be assigned that File. You will get the notification via mail. Then start working on that file.

   Maintainers will add your username and Pull Request next to your selected page in the below checklist.

5. Go to your GitHub forked repository and select the “<mark>dev-1.23-bn.1</mark>” branch.

   ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1672909357517/24bc079e-116b-4b43-8b35-9c363172a721.png align="center")

> **_Note: We do not have any work in Main Branch. All Contributions should be made on the_** `dev-1.23-bn.1` **_branch._**

1. There you go to the targeted folder.Open the `Chosen_file.md` you want to work with in another tab in the “en” Folder there.

   ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1672910950987/613dbf57-1814-435f-a43c-7575be90361d.png align="center")

   Then go back to targeted folder and then go to the “bn” folder. Create a new file by clicking on `Create New Files` and name it `Chosen_file.md` opened from en folder a while ago.

2. Now,You need to rewrite the text of the `Chosen_file.md` in simple, straightforward language. Do not use Google Translate to directly translate the text.

# Bonus Tips:

Thank you for reading till now! Now I'll share some Bonus Tips which will help you in you to contribute!

1. **<mark>Become familiar with Kubernetes and its terminology:</mark>**

   Before you start localizing, it is important to familiarize yourself with Kubernetes and its terminology. This will help you understand the content that you are translating and ensure that you are using the correct terminology. You can learn more about Kubernetes by reading the documentation and participating in online communities such as the Kubernetes Slack channel.

2. <mark>Use the Kubernetes translation tool</mark>

   Kubernetes has a translation tool called Weblate that makes it easy to contribute translations. To use the tool, you will need to sign up for a Weblate account and request access to the Kubernetes project. Once you have access, you can start translating the content into Bengali.

3. <mark>Review and submit your translations</mark>

   After you have translated the content, it is important to review your work to ensure that it is accurate and reads well in Bengali. You can ask for help from other members of the Localization SIG if you need assistance. Once you are satisfied with your translations, you can submit them for review by the SIG.
