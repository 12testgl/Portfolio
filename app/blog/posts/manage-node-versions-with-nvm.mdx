## Introduction:

When working with Node.js, you might need to install multiple versions of the runtime.

But, Managing node versions can be tricky for many developers!

Don't Worry!

In this Blog, I will guide you on how to install and manage different node versions with NVM.

### Prerequisites:

1. [Install Node.js](https://youtu.be/JINE4D0Syqw)
2. [Install Node Version Manager](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/)

## What is NVM?

NVM stands for Node Version Manager. It's a command line tool that helps us to manage and switch to different versions of Node.js.

## **Managing Node versions with NVM**

#### **1.Check Available Node versions:**

Before Installing any node version let's check the available Node versions. To check available versions, Run the following command in your command prompt:

```bash
nvm ls available
```

After running this code, You will get the following results:

#### **2.Install Multiple Versions of Node.js:**

One of the most important parts of nvm is installing different versions of Node.js.

For this, nvm provides the `nvm install` command. You can install specific versions by running this command followed by the version you want. For example:

```bash
nvm install 12.14.1
```

> Tip:
>
> nvm follows [**SemVer**](http://semver.org/), so if you want to install, for example, the latest `12.14` patch, you can do it by running:
>
> ```bash
> nvm install 12.14
> ```
>
> Here, '`12`'represents Major Version & '`14`' represents Minor Version.

#### **3.Install the Latest Version of Node:**

To install the latest version of Node, Run:

```bash
nvm install latest
```

<div data-node-type="callout">
  <div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
  <div data-node-type="callout-text">
    Tip: It is always better to install the long-term support (LTS) version of
    Node because it is less buggy.
  </div>
</div>

> To install the LTS version of Node, Run:
>
> ```bash
> nvm install lts
> ```
>
> After that you'll get :

#### **4.Install specific Node Version:**

To install that specific version, Run:

```bash
nvm install node-version-number
```

Replace the \`node-version-number\` with your desired Node version.

Once you install a version of Node, the corresponding version of NPM is installed for you. So you donâ€™t need to install NPM separately.

#### **5.Uninstall Any Instances of Node:**

To uninstall any instance you no longer think is useful, by running:

```bash
nvm uninstall node-version-number
```

#### **6.See Installed Node Versions:**

To see the list of Node versions you have installed on your Windows machine, run:

```bash
nvm list
```

#### **7.Switching Versions of Node:**

As you can see in the previous image that I'm currently using `18.16.1`

If you want to switch your version to another version (eg. `18.17.0`)

Use the Following Command:

```bash
nvm use 18.17.0 //replace the version number with your desired one
```

To use a specific version of Node, run:

- `nvm use latest` to use the latest version
- `nvm use lts` to use the long-term support version

These are some processes to manage Node versions.
