## Introduction

One of the fundamental concepts of JavaScript is the call stack, which is a mechanism that tracks the execution of code in a JavaScript program.

In this article, we will explore the call stack of JavaScript, its role in the execution of code, and how it works.

## What is the Call Stack?

> A **call stack** is a mechanism to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple [functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/function) — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function.

In simple words, The call stack is like a list of tasks that your computer keeps track of when you run a program written in JavaScript.Whenever a function is called, it's added to the top of the list.

### Basic Terminologies:

Before learning Call-stacks workflow, let's go through some common terminologies that are used here to understand things better.

1. Top: It means the Top most element that is currently being executed.
2. Push: When we add a function to the top of the call stack, the process is called Push.
3. Pop: After executing the process where the functions are removed from the call stack is known as Pop.

## How does the Call Stack Work?

Call Stack basically works on the LIFO(Last In, First Out ) principle. That means the function that enters the stack at last finishes at first, and then the remaining functions finish.

Sounds confusing?

Let's understand this with diagrams and examples,

```javascript
function firstFunction() {
  console.log("first Function completed");
}
function secondFunction() {
  firstFunction();
  console.log("second Function completed");
}
secondFunction();
// output
// first Function completed
// second Function completed
```

So From the output, you can understand that `firstFunction()` is executed before then `secondFunction()` completes its execution. As mentioned before it's because of the LIFO principle.

Now Let's understand how it's working behind the scenes with some diagrams.

At first Global object/Window object is created in the Call stack

Next when `secondFunction()` is called, it creates an empty stack frame & its execution context. And the stack is pushed to the Top of the Call-stack.

Then when `secondFunction()` starts executing, it calls another function `firstFunction()` . Just like the previous one, it creates another empty stack and pushes it to the Top of the call stack.

At this point, all of the required functions are **pushed** to the Class Stack in a particular sequence, where the `firstFunction()` function is at the **top** of the Class Stack

Now, the `firstFunction()` executes and Pops it out from the call stack.

After the removal of the `firstFunction()` , `secondFunction()` is the Top function. And just like the previous function it executes and pops out from the stack.

As soon as the execution of `secondFunction()` function gets complete, and **Call Stack** becomes **empty**, the JavaScript engine will **stop** the **execution** and move toward the other execution tasks:

## What is Stack-Overflow?

Wait wait; we are not discussing about the popular website where you can ask your questions and get answers!

![Stack Overflow Launches Free Tier of Stack Overflow for Teams | Business  Wire](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20210317005585/en/865528/23/logo-stackoverflow.jpg align="left")

We are discussing the concept of Stackoverflow.

Let's understand this concept,

The call stack has a maximum size of memory allotted. Stack Overflow occurs when the number of function calls added to the stack increases the stack’s maximum limit (the call stack has a maximum size).

One example is Recursion without a base case,

```javascript
function Recursion() {
  Recursion();
}
Recursion();
```

Here We haven't added the base case, So it's an infinite recursive call. The `Recursion()` will run until the browser throws a “Maximum call size exceeded”. And that is a stack overflow.
