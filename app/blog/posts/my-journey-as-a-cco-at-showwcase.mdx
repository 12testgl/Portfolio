Hey There!üëãüèº

This article won't be a very technical one! Here I'll share My Journey as a CCO (Chief Creative Officer) at Showwcase, How I got the Chance, my learnings, and many more...

So Let's Jump into it!

## What is CCO?

CCO stands for **Chief Creative Officer**. Showwcase is a global community of creative professionals, and CCOs are the leaders who are responsible for driving innovation and creativity within the community.

They are passionate about empowering and inspiring the next generation of leaders, and they provide unique opportunities for developers to create a positive impact in their communities and globally.

This was my first interview, and as a newbie, I was pretty nervous!

However, I was fortunate enough to clear the interview round and secure my first role as CCO at Showwcase.

The interview process was not heavily focused on technical aspects. Instead, it delved into why I wanted to pursue this role, my plans, execution strategies, and my previous experiences with communities.

Another thing that helped me to clear the interview was my online presence, I was pretty active on the Discord community and actively contributed to their Javascript Roadmap.

For that, I got recognition from Team Showwcase.

## Things I learned:

This journey turned out to be a great learning experience.

It provided insights into the dynamics of remote work culture and taught me the importance of being accountable for tasks.

During my tenure as a CCO, I hosted several Twitter spaces and collaborated with various folks and communities. In the meantime made some good friends as well!

One standout experience was the successful organization of a Blog-a-thon in collaboration with Grow-In Community.

It was my first time organizing any event as a Host! I was pretty nervous! But thanks to my amazing Co-Hosts Ansal Pandey & Akshay Kumar, We made it successful!

Moreover from that, I got to know how much work we need to do behind the scenes to make an event Successful! For that, I was Selected as a "CCO of the Month" from Showwcase!
