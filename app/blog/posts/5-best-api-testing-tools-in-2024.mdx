## Introduction

With so many different API test management tools available, Choosing the right tool can be challenging. In 2024, there are several outstanding API tools that cater to the needs of developers.

In this Article,We will explore 5 Best API Testing Tools to use in 2024.

So without delaying further, Let's START!

## What is API?

The Full Form of API is an Application Programming Interface. In Simple words, an API helps two different software to communicate and exchange data with each other.

Didn't get it?

No Worries! Let's understand this with a Story!

![API (Application Programming Interface)](https://imgs.search.brave.com/WPWHyLk6RSlSD_UOlYDhwrZN8YonTKgMuhT1KEC7_w4/rs:fit:860:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRp/YS5nZWVrc2Zvcmdl/ZWtzLm9yZy93cC1j/b250ZW50L3VwbG9h/ZHMvMjAyMzAyMTYx/NzAzNDkvV2hhdC1p/cy1hbi1BUEkucG5n align="left")

Suppose We (the client) go to a restaurant, and we want to order some food.

So, we'll see the menu (the API Documentation ) and make our order to the Waiter (request to the API).

Now the Waiter (the API) will take our order to the Chef (the Server) and bring back our food (the server's response) when it's prepared.

And thus we can Enjoy our Food!

On the web, The API works just like the Waiter, It takes our request and brings back the information from the server as a response.

## What is API Testing?

Now we know what is an API and How it Works! Let's understand API Testing!

API testing is a type of testing that focuses on verifying the functionality, performance, and security of the API.

In simple words, It ensures that it's working properly!

## 5 Best API Testing Tools:

Now We'll explore 5 Best API testing Tools to make Our APIs Bug free.

### 1.Keploy

![Keploy](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1705729834504/a65aeb6d-ee22-4638-92ac-8ae0185371e1.png align="left")

Keploy is an innovative open-source tool that is transforming the landscape of API testing by converting user traffic into test cases and data stubs. It offers solution to several challenges in software development and testing, such as blind network calls, time-consuming manual test writing, inefficient code paths, dependency chaos, and mystery production issues.

Keploy simplifies testing for developers by capturing network interactions and generating automated tests. Plus, we accelerate development and enhance team collaboration.

### 2\. Postman

Postman is a leading API testing tool that is compatible with Linux, MacOS, and Windows operating systems. It's simple and Intuitive UI makes it easier for all levels of users. Also Its runtime supports popular patterns and libraries that test and debug quickly.

It offers a wide range of features, allowing users to create functional, integration, and regression tests efficiently.

Users can choose between using the Command Line Interface (CLI) or a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that is easy to navigate.Also Users can create and manage multiple environments for seamless switching between different development, testing, and production environments.

### 3\. SoapUI:

SoapUI is a specialised tool designed for testing REST, SOAP, and GraphQL APIs. It allows us to easily create and execute automated functional, regression, and load tests.

SoapUI supports a variety of protocols and standards, making it suitable for building applications or services based on different technologies.

### 4\. Rapid API

![Rapid API](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1706265755088/9524919e-6a39-4420-ac8e-3980e6463237.png align="center")

Rapid API is a famous API testing and monitoring tool. It supports deep functional testing for REST, SOAP, and GraphQL APIs.Â It allows us to easily integrate the tool into CI/CD pipelines.

It offers a global monitoring feature that assesses API tests through reports, analytics, and other monitoring capabilities, which allows us to track the performance and health of their APIs across different locations.

### 5\. REST-assured

![REST-assured](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1706334857519/585bb172-becb-4612-afaa-5abe72af08a5.png align="center")

REST Assured is a popular testing framework for RESTful APIs. Developers who understand Java programming language can use REST Assured to test resting services.

It simplifies API testing by providing a convenient syntax, allowing testers to create requests without the need to write code from scratch. REST assured is equally able to combine tests of REST services and UI in a single framework.
