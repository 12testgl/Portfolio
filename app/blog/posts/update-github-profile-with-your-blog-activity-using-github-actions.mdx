## Introduction

GitHub Actions can do so much, We usually see it running automated tests, but it can update your GitHub Profile with your activity from other platforms like YouTube, Blog posts, and more! This blog post will teach you how to update your GitHub profile using GitHub actions.

> We'll be using [blog-articles.yml](https://github.com/FrancescoXX/FrancescoXX/blob/main/.github/workflows/blog-articles.yml) GitHub Action by [Francesco Ciulla](https://github.com/FrancescoXX)

## Getting started

- Go to your Profile ReadMe.
- Add a heading (e.g. Recent articles on Hashnode).
  ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1666784715058/eAMNRup-J.png align="left")
- Add the following code to your `README.md`

```plaintext
<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:END -->
```

- The workflow will replace the comment above with the list of published blog posts.
- Save the changes by clicking on the Commit changes button.
- Then go to your Readme file and click on "`Add Files`" & select Create New file
- In the name field, enter `.github/workflows/blog-post-workflow.yml`
- Add the following code to the `Edit new file tab` .

```YAML
name: Latest blog articles
on:
  schedule: # Run workflow automatically
    - cron: '0 * * * *' # Runs every hour, on the hour
  workflow_dispatch: # Run workflow manually (without waiting for the cron to be called), through the Github Actions Workflow page directly
jobs:
  update-readme-with-hashnode-blog:
    name: Update this repo's README with the latest hashnode blog posts
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow@master
        with:
          feed_list: "https://blog.francescociulla.com/rss.xml"
```

This will successfully create the workflow. It will fetch new blog posts from your Hashnode profile and add them to your README file every hour.
