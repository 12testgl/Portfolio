## Introduction

The [first part](https://arindam1729.hashnode.dev/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-github-part-1) of this series focused on the GitHub introduction, and the second part focused on the GitHub basics such as forking & creating GitHub Repo. Although it may take a little more time to get both parts working, youâ€™ll be able to use it for a long time.

## How to create a GitHub repository?

To put your project up on GitHub, you will need to create a repository for it to live in.

* In the upper-right corner of any page, use the `+` drop-down menu, and select New repository.
    
* Type a short, memorable name for your repository. For example, "hello-world".
    
* Optionally, add a description of your repository. For example, "My first repository on GitHub."
    
* !\[image.png\](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1665575020618/uF7SOX6Cq.png align="left")
    
* Choose a repository visibility.
    
* Select Initialize this repository with a README.
    
* Click Create repository.
    

Congratulations! You've successfully created your first repository and initialized it with a README file.

## How to commit changes in the repository?

A commit is like a snapshot of all the files in your project at a particular point in time.

* In your repository's list of files, click README.md.
    
* Above the file's content, click the pen sign .
    
* On the Edit file tab, type some information about yourself.
    
* Above the new content, click Preview changes.
    
* At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message.
    
* Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request
    
* Click Propose file change
    

## How to fork a GitHub repository?

* On GitHub.com, navigate to the \[EddieHubCommunity/hacktoberfest-practice\](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/hacktoberfest-practice)repository.
    
* In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
    
* Select an owner for the forked repository.
    
* By default, forks are named the same as their parent repositories. You can change the name of the fork to distinguish it further.
    
* Optionally, add a description of your fork
    
* Choose whether to copy only the default branch or all branches to the new fork. For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open-source projects, you only need to copy the default branch. By default, only the default branch is copied.
    
* Click Create fork.
