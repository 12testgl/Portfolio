# Introduction

My 100 Days of Code Journey was a 100-day journey where I wrote code as I was learning programming. You don’t need to do something like this, but it’s a great way to get in the habit of coding.

# My Journey :

After giving my Entrance exam, I was looking to start a career in the tech industry. Then I came across Kunal Kushwaha's Roadmap Video and found out about his courses. After listening to his podcasts, I came to know that I should take extra care of my Twitter feed, and only send quality content. He also mentions the importance of Twitter in tech.

After that, I came to know about the 100 Days of Code Challenge and committed to it publicly.

## My learnings:

- I started my programming journey with Python. I learned the basics and some advanced concepts.
- Joined various Twitter spaces and listened to podcasts which helped me to stay motivated, and decide what to learn and How to learn. Kunal's Open Source cafe is one of them! It encouraged me a lot to Contribute to Open source.
- First Open Source Contribution: My first contribution was to Eddie's Hacktoberfest-Practice Repo. I was really grateful to Pradumna for merging my first PR. Eddiehub is a great place for newbies.

- Started learning DSA+JAVA from Kunal's Great Course.

- My First Hacktoberfest! It was my first hacktoberfest and My 4 PRs were merged. it was a great experience. Learned various things on the go.
