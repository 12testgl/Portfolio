# Setting up Tailwind

![Installation - Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/api/og?path=/docs/installation align="left")

To install Tailwind CSS, follow the following steps:

1. At First, Initialize the Directory as a Node.js Project.

   ```nginx
   npm init -y
   ```

2. Next, Install the required packages.

   ```nginx
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   ```

3. Next, you must create a configuration file for your project. To generate this default configuration, you can run:

   ```nginx
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```

   This will create a `tailwind.config.js` file in your project root directory.

4. Now create a folder input.css and add the `@tailwind` directives for each of Tailwindâ€™s layers to your main CSS file.

   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

5. Now, Add the paths to all of your template files in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

   ```javascript
   /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
   module.exports = {
     content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   };
   ```

6. Next, Run the following command to start the server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. Now you can use Tailwind CSS classes in your HTML files.

# Best Practices:

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when using Tailwind CSS:

1. Always use fewer utility classes when possible. It helps to keep your HTML file clean & readable
2. When writing a string of multiple utility classes, always do so in an order with meaning. The "Concentric CSS" approach works well with utility classes (i.e.,. 1. positioning/visibility 2. box model 3. borders 4. backgrounds 5. typography 6. other visual adjustments).
3. Instead of using the long form `block sm:block md:flex lg:flex xl:flex` for a `<div>` element you can just write `md:flex`.
4. By using utility-first CSS, you don't need to invent "semantic" class names for a single purpose `<div>`s so there is no reason to avoid using them when they are helpful.
5. Do not `@apply` component classes in other components. For example, maintaining separate `.btn` and `.btn-blue` classes rather than using `.btn-blue { @apply btn; }`
