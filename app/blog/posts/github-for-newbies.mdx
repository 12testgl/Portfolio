## Introduction

If you’re developing [Open-Source](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source) software, GitHub is an excellent place to store it, collaborate with other developers on it, as well as hosting your own public repositories. If you are just starting out with programming and need some help getting started, then GitHub will be a good place to start.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is an online software development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It enables developers to upload their own code files and to collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects. GitHub also serves as a social networking site in which developers can openly network, collaborate, and pitch their work.

GitHub allows software developers and engineers to create remote, public-facing repositories on the cloud for free. Once you’ve set up a repository on GitHub, you can copy it to your device, add and modify files locally, then “push” your changes back to the repository where your changes are displayed to the public.

## What is Version Control?

Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though, in reality, you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.

## How to Use GitHub?

GitHub is one kind of Social networking site (like Facebook,Instagram) for developers to share their code and view other's code. Here You can follow and rate each other's work.

GitHub can also be used as a Portfolio page. It also allows you to receive updates about the different projects which you are interested in and communicate with other members in public or private.

Once you a create GitHub account, you need to create a repository.
