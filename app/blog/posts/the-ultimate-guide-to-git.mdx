## Working with Git

Here is a basic overview of how to work with Git:

* Initialize Git on a folder,making it a Repository
    
* Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
    
* When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
    
* You select the modified files you want to stage
    
* The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
    
* Git allows us to see the full history of every commit
    
* You can revert back to any previous commit
    
* Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, it keeps track of changes made in each commit!

## Git Workflow

The Git workflow is divided into three states:

* **Working directory:** Modified files,but untracked and not yet ready to commit
    
* **Staging directory:** Adding modified files to the staging environment means they are ready to commit.
    
* **Committed:** Snapshots of files from the staging area saved in the commit history
